/**
 * Does the exported HTML *look* like the slide?
 *
 * Run *by Electron*: `electron scripts/compare-slides.cjs <job.json>`.
 *
 * Every other check in this repository compares deck JSON against deck JSON,
 * and for an export that writes `left/top/width/height` and reads the same
 * numbers back, that is very nearly a tautology: a shape can export as an empty
 * div and a cropped photo can export squashed, and the round trip still says
 * "identical". Only pixels can tell.
 *
 * So: paint the slide twice — once with the real Player from an exported
 * bundle, once by opening the authoring file the way a browser would — and
 * compare the two images. The Player is the definition of correct, because it
 * is what the projector runs.
